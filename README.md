Overview
The Happy Thoughts API is a project  focusing on the backend of Technigos "Happy Thoughts" application. The main goal was to provide functional endpoints for user interactions such as posting new thoughts and adding hearts to existing ones.

Technologies
I've used Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The Mongoose ODM has been particularly helpful for data modeling and validation. I've implemented POST requests for creating new thoughts and GET requests for retrieving them.
